## Overview
Consent Flow Simulator is a browser-based educational tool that demonstrates how user consent decisions affect data collection on modern websites. Instead of performing real tracking, the project visually simulates how analytics and marketing systems activate or remain blocked based on user choices.

The goal is to make privacy concepts transparent, interactive, and easy to understand.
